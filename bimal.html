						<h3>BIMAL GHARTI MAGAR</h3>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				    Bimal Gharti Magar (Nepali: विमल घर्ती मगर; born on 26 January 1998 is a Nepalesefootballer who plays as a forward for Nepalese club Three Star Cluband the Nepal national team. Bimal was the product of Central ANFA Academy, which is controlled by the All Nepal Football Association(ANFA). Bimal is also the sixth youngest male scorer and international debutant in the world, making him the youngest Nepalese player to debut (at the age of 14) and score (at the age of 15) for the Nepal national team.

                    Magar was born in Nawalparasi, Panchanagar 1, Nepal and is from Bhutaha village in Nawalparasi. Magar's father, Hom Bahadur was also a footballer who played locally. It was his father and his childhood mentor who inspired Magar to take up football. Hom Bahadur's greatest wish was to see Magar play for the national team, but he died in a motorbike accident before Magar made it to the highest level.[4] He broke the previous record of Bharat Khawas.
                    On 26 May 2016, while Magar was in Belgium and his mother was out for some bank work, Magar's sister was found dead in her home. The investigation regarding the death is in progress and the police have arrested Rudra Narayan Chaudhary aka "Aashish" as a suspect, who was in a relationship with the deceased for the past four years.

                    Magar was selected by the All Nepal Football Association(ANFA) to join the ANFA Academy in Butwal after his performance for the Butwal Elite English School during the Subroto Cup, held in New Delhi. The Butwal Elite English School went on to win the tournament.Subsequently, that year, during the AFC U-14 Football Festival Magar was then transferred to the Central ANFA Academy, where he gained further attention by senior officials at ANFA. Which in turn, lead to Magar being included in the national team's squad during a friendly against Bangladesh at the age of 14.[6][7]

                    During November 2013, Magar was invited for a 2-week trial with the Dutch club, FC Twente[8] where he scored 4 goals with 1 assist during a friendly match against HSC 21 U-19, which ended in a 9-0 victory for FC Twente U-16.[9] However, due employment laws and FIFA regulations on youth transfers[10][11]it was not possible to sign Magar at the age of 16, despite FC Twente being 'impressed' with his performance.[12][13] It is also understood that at the time, Bimal was linked to Manchester United and Lierse SK.
                    In March 2014, Magar was granted a Belgian visa to go to Europe from April to May that year and run trials for Anderlecht's U-16 squad.[16] As part of the trials, Magar also took part in three youth tournaments, AEGON Future Cup,[17][18] the Ten Brinke Bouw Tournament, and the Nuenen Tournament.[19] Both trials for FC Twente and RSC Anderlechtwere carried out under the recommendation and oversight of Rene Koster, the former coach for the Bangladesh U-17 Team.[20]
                    On 8 June 2014 Magar penned a new 1-year deal to join Anderlecht U-19. The ANFA confirmed that Magar's contract began from July 26, 2014 to May 31, 2015 with Anderlechtbearing all expenses.[21][22][23] Bimal's first tournament with Anderlecht was the Copa del Agatha in St. Agatha, North Brabant, Netherlands. After scoring two goals, Bimal finished the tournament as a runner-up for RSC Anderlecht, losing 0–3 to Atletico Paranaense in the final.[24] Bimal was absent during the 2014 Otten Cup due to a minor injury.
